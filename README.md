# Weather Tracking App      

Welcome to the WeatherTracker! Check the deployed application out at https://rickyesc1.github.io/weathermap/

This is the 6th and final homework assignment before jumping into the projects with our groups, this web app is a simple weather-related-results-only search engine that allows a user to look up the weather now and in the coming days so that they may plan a trip accordingly. This is In order to showcase a dynamic use of CSS, Bootstrap, third-party API's, and Javascript, which we have been learning very much about up until this point. 

At the time of the writing of this readme the app is still in it's baby-state. In the near future the page styling and aesthetic will be changed to look unique from the rest of the classes, and I want to add a way to see multiple cities at once. 

## Motivation  

Of course the existence of this project follows the same motive as all the other apps that precede it: I want to get an A overall in the class. And the only way to achieve that is by doing all my assignments well. Additionally, I share all the assignments that we do with my friends and family in hopes that someone may use them or find it useful. A few people have told me apps like the work-day scheduler were particularly useful both for function and the code that was used.

Instead of doing this as a homework assignment, we took time in class with our professor walking us through the process to complete the app. This was a very helpful way to learn, but I do not like my app looking like everyone elses.

As far as maintenance of the app, as previously stated in the introduction, I will be going back to this to update the styling to an aesthetic that pleases my eye and isn't what the professor showed or identical to my classmates etc. 

## Build Status:

Up and running, uses continous integration. 

## Code Style

The coding style that was used and I will adapt the existing code into is object-oriented and functional. 

## Demonstration of Application:
